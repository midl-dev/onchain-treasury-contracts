# Polkadot treasury contracts and invoices

This document is written by MIDL.dev, a blockchain infrastructure company. It is inspired by [Polkascan social contract](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract).

The purpose of this repository is to host social contracts and invoices for infrastructure work performed for the benefit of [Substrate](https://substrate.dev) chains such as Polkadot and Kusama.
